Introduction
This project implements a resilient email sending service that can automatically switch to a backup SMTP provider if the primary provider fails. It is built using TypeScript and utilizes nodemailer for handling SMTP connections.

Features
Primary and Backup SMTP Providers: Automatically switches to a backup provider if the primary one fails.
Configurable via Environment Variables: SMTP credentials and other configurations are managed via .env file.
Logging: Detailed logging for troubleshooting and monitoring.
Setup Instructions
1. Prerequisites
Before setting up the project, ensure you have the following installed:

Node.js (version 18.17.0 or later)
npm (version 10.8.2 or later)

touch .env
Add the following environment variables to the .env file:

env
Copy code
# Primary SMTP Provider
SMTP_HOST=smtp.gmail.com
SMTP_PORT=587
SMTP_USER=your_primary_email@gmail.com
SMTP_PASS=your_primary_app_password

# Backup SMTP Provider
BACKUP_SMTP_HOST=smtp.mail.yahoo.com
BACKUP_SMTP_PORT=587
BACKUP_SMTP_USER=your_backup_email@yahoo.com
BACKUP_SMTP_PASS=your_backup_app_password
5. Compile TypeScript
Compile the TypeScript files to JavaScript:

bash
Copy code
npx tsc
6. Run the Service
You can run the service using ts-node:

bash
Copy code
npx ts-node src/index.ts
Or, if you prefer running the compiled JavaScript:

bash
Copy code
node dist/index.js
Usage
To use the service, simply invoke the sendEmail function defined in src/services/emailService.ts. The service will attempt to send an email using the primary SMTP provider and will failover to the backup provider if necessary.

Example usage:

typescript
Copy code
import { sendEmail } from './services/emailService';

sendEmail({
  from: 'your_email@gmail.com',
  to: 'recipient@example.com',
  subject: 'Test Email',
  text: 'Hello, this is a test email.',
});
Environment Variables
The following environment variables are required:

SMTP_HOST: Hostname of the primary SMTP server.
SMTP_PORT: Port number for the primary SMTP server.
SMTP_USER: Username for the primary SMTP server.
SMTP_PASS: Password (or App Password) for the primary SMTP server.
BACKUP_SMTP_HOST: Hostname of the backup SMTP server.
BACKUP_SMTP_PORT: Port number for the backup SMTP server.
BACKUP_SMTP_USER: Username for the backup SMTP server.
BACKUP_SMTP_PASS: Password (or App Password) for the backup SMTP server.
Assumptions
SMTP Credentials: You have valid credentials for both the primary and backup SMTP providers.
Network Accessibility: The service has network access to the SMTP servers.
Security Settings: If using Google, you've either enabled "Less secure app access" or generated an App Password for accounts with 2FA.
Node.js Version: The project assumes you're using Node.js version 18.17.0 or later, as required by the npm version.
Troubleshooting
Invalid login: 535 5.7.8 Username and Password not accepted:

Ensure that your credentials are correct.
If using Google, consider generating an App Password if you have 2FA enabled.
Error: getaddrinfo ENOTFOUND smtp.example.com:

Check that your SMTP host is correctly configured in the .env file.
Ensure there are no network connectivity issues.
Too many bad auth attempts:

You may need to wait before retrying due to account lockout.
Check your email providerâ€™s security settings.
